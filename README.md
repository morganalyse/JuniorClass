# JuniorClass

<h1>And we're MAC!</h1>
We are a group of junior girls from Madison Academic High school in Jackson TN. We are so excited to be making a website for the graduating class of 2021. We chose our team name MAC, which stands for Morgan, Amber, and Cassie to represent how we are all individually committed to our group project. Madison Academic is a prestigious high school in Jackson that requires an application process followed by a background check. We specifically decided to make a website for the current junior class, because we are by far the best class to attend Madison Academic.

Our website is divided into six different subparts. The parts include our homepage, activities, sports, events, graduation, and contacts page. Our homepage is very simple but catches the eye of our audience with the beautiful portrait of our school. Our color scheme is a series of school colors, which are maroon, white, and black with a touch of gray to represent our school pride. We decided to add a navbar that contains an easy to use drop down. The activities page is a colorful yet informational page that includes the five main elective classes that are very important to the culture at Madison Academic. Also we have added a carousel that includes pictures of the classes. The events page is a page that is showing the most important events that Madison is participating in.
