<h1>And we're MAC!</h1>
We are a group of junior girls from Madison Academic Highschool in Jackson TN. We are so excited to be making a website for the graduating class of 2021. We chose our team name MAC, which stands for Morgan, Amber, and Cassie to represent how we are all individually committed to our group project. Madison Academic is a prestigious highschool in Jackson that requires a application process followed by a background check. We specifically decided to  make a website for the current junior class, because we are by far the best class to attend Madison Academic.

Our website is divided into six different subparts. The parts include our homepage, activities, sports, events, graduation, and contacts page. Our homepage is very simple but catches the audiences eye with the beautiful portrait of our school. Our color scheme is a series of school colors, which are maroon, white, and black with a touch of gray to represent our school pride.
